🎯 Presentation: Playbooks & ADK – From Basics to Implementation
🔹 Slide 1: What Are Playbooks?
Definition:
A playbook in AI agent development is a step-by-step guide or script that defines the behavior, goals, and conversation flows for an AI agent.

🧭 Slide 2: Why Are Playbooks Important?
✅ Provide structure to conversational agents

✅ Ensure consistency across multi-agent systems

✅ Help with onboarding new team members

✅ Aid compliance in regulated domains (e.g., healthcare)

✅ Serve as a foundation before technical implementation

📘 Slide 3: Components of a Playbook
Component	Description
Agent Name	Name of the agent (e.g., Claims Processing Agent)
Overview	What the agent is designed to do
Goals	What the agent should achieve
Parameters	Data to be captured (e.g., patient ID, claim number)
Conversation Flow	The logic it follows in a conversation
Escalation	When it should hand off to a human agent
Tools/Integrations	APIs, databases, or systems it connects to

🧪 Slide 4: Example – Claims Processing Agent (Playbook Sample)
Agent Name: Claims Processing Agent
Goal: Automate processing of insurance claims
Instructions:

Ask for $claimID, $patientID, $serviceDate, $claimType

Verify identity using $authToken

Call ${TOOL:getClaimStatus} with captured parameters

Present claim status and offer next steps

If status is "denied", ask if user wants to appeal

🛠️ Slide 5: What is ADK (Agent Developer Kit)?
Definition:
ADK is a toolkit or SDK that provides the necessary libraries, components, and interfaces to build and deploy AI agents within platforms like Vertex AI or CCAI.

🔍 Slide 6: What Does ADK Include?
🧩 Prebuilt agent templates

🧠 State and context management modules

🔄 Tool calling frameworks (to external APIs/tools)

🔒 Security and error handling mechanisms

📊 Logging, analytics, and testing support

📌 Slide 7: Playbook vs ADK
Feature	Playbook	ADK (Agent Developer Kit)
Focus	Strategy and flow design	Technical implementation
Format	Document / Script	Code / SDK
Used By	Product managers, designers	Developers, engineers
Purpose	Define what the agent should do	Build how the agent does it
Example	“Ask user for claim number...”	call_tool("getClaimStatus", {...})

💡 Slide 8: Example Workflow – Playbook to ADK
Design playbook for "Patient Inquiry Agent"

Goals, flows, parameters

Convert into ADK implementation

Use LangChain or ADK template

Connect to tools like BigQuery

Deploy on Vertex AI Agent Builder

Test, monitor, and refine

🧠 Slide 9: Use Case – Insurance Multi-Agent System
Agent	Role	Tools Used
Patient Inquiry Agent	Answer FAQs from patients	Dialogflow CX + BigQuery
Claims Processing Agent	Check claim status	Dataflow + LangChain
Data Retrieval Agent	Fetch patient records securely	Vertex AI + Vector DBs

🚀 Slide 10: Key Takeaways
Playbooks guide what the agent should do

ADK defines how the agent behaves and functions

Together, they streamline multi-agent systems in platforms like Vertex AI

Crucial for healthcare, finance, and customer service use cases
