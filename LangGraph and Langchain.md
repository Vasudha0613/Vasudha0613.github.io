LangGraph is a Python framework designed to build stateful, multi-agent AI workflows using graphs of Large Language Models (LLMs). It's built on top of LangChain and allows developers to model complex, dynamic conversations or processes as directed graphs, where nodes are functions (often backed by LLMs) and edges define the flow of logic between them.

🔹 What Is LangGraph?
LangGraph is:

A graph-based orchestration framework for AI agents and workflows.

Stateful: It remembers what’s happened in the conversation or task.

Built on LangChain, so it uses chains, tools, agents, and memory.

Good for building multi-agent systems, complex task flows, or dialog managers where traditional linear logic falls short.

🔧 How It Works:
You define nodes (functions powered by LLMs or tools).

You define edges (what happens after each node).

LangGraph manages the execution path, memory, and state transitions.

✅ Key Features:
Feature	Description
Multi-Agent Support	Each node can act as an independent agent. Great for teamwork-style AI systems.
Looping & Branching	Unlike simple chains, LangGraph supports loops, retries, or conditional paths.
Memory Integration	Maintains state or conversation history across the graph.
Tool Calling	Nodes can invoke APIs, databases, or calculators as tools.
RAG-friendly	Useful in Retrieval-Augmented Generation setups with custom data sources.

📘 Use Case Examples:
AI customer support system where one agent handles billing, another handles tech issues.

A multi-step reasoning bot that plans, searches, analyzes, and summarizes.

A healthcare assistant that routes inquiries to claim agents, appointment schedulers, or medical record retrievers.

🧠 Example Flow:
plaintext
Copy
User Query → Planner Agent → [Search Agent → Summarizer] → Response Generator
Each step is a node, and LangGraph manages how the user’s question flows through this graph based on logic and state.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Built with Python

Depends on LangChain

Works with OpenAI, Vertex AI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, etc.

LangChain is an open-source Python (and JS) framework that helps developers build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) — like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude — by making it easier to connect these models with external data, tools, and chains of logic.

🔍 Why Use LangChain?
LLMs are powerful but limited — they don't remember context well, can't access live data, or take structured action. LangChain solves this by:

Giving LLMs tools (like search, APIs, databases).

Adding memory (conversation history, facts).

Allowing chaining of multiple steps (e.g., retrieve info → summarize → act).

 Example Use Case:
Imagine you're building a healthcare assistant:

Patient asks: "What’s covered under my plan?"

LangChain:

Retrieves the plan from a vector database.

Summarizes it with an LLM.

Uses memory to continue the conversation naturally.

🧠 In Simple Terms:
LangChain is like a brain framework for LLMs — it gives them memory, tools, and the ability to reason through multiple steps, so they can work like smart assistants rather than just chatbots.
