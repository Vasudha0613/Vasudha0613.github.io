🧠 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an AI architecture that combines a retrieval system (like a search engine or vector database) with a language model (like GPT or PaLM) to generate more accurate, grounded, and up-to-date responses.

🔍 In Simple Terms:
RAG = Search + Generate
Instead of relying only on what a model "knows", it retrieves relevant information first, then uses that to generate a response.

🔧 How RAG Works:
User Asks a Question
→ e.g., “What’s covered under my 2024 health insurance plan?”

Retriever Searches Data
→ Uses embeddings and a vector database (e.g., FAISS or ChromaDB) to fetch relevant documents or text chunks.

LLM Reads Retrieved Context
→ The LLM (like GPT-4, PaLM, Claude) uses the retrieved data as context.

Model Generates a Response
→ It answers the question based on the retrieved data, not just its training knowledge.

✅ Why RAG Is Important:
Keeps answers accurate and current

Reduces hallucination (wrong or made-up answers)

No need to retrain the model for every update

Great for domain-specific questions (e.g., healthcare, legal, finance)

🧪 Example Use Case in Healthcare:
A patient asks a chatbot, “Does my plan cover physical therapy?”
The system retrieves the exact policy document section and feeds it into the model.
The model replies with: “Yes, your plan covers up to 20 sessions per year for physical therapy.”
