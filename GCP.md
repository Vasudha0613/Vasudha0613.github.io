1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

2.       is the software defined network in GCP,all the subnets r interconnected and isolated from one another and allows to each environment(dev,test,prod)
3.    Each VPC can have multiple subnets, and each subnet exists within a single region and defines a range of IP addresses.

 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
A virtualized network that provides IP address management, routing, firewall rules, and VPN services for your GCP resources.
