EDA 
Exploratory Data Analysis?it is important first step in any data science or machine learning workflow. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often using visual methods.

EDA  involves:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Load and Inspect Data

Check shape, head, tail, types

Detect missing values

Understand data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics

Mean, median, mode

Min, max, standard deviation


3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning

      Handle missing values

      Fix data types

      Remove duplicates

      Handle outliers


4Ô∏è‚É£ Univariate Analysis

      Distribution of each variable

      Histograms, boxplots, bar charts


5Ô∏è‚É£ Bivariate / Multivariate Analysis

Correlations between variables

Scatter plots, pair plots, heatmaps, grouped bar plots

6Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering (optional during EDA)

Creating new variables based on existing ones

7Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization

Visualizing relationships, trends, and patterns

Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly






## GCP-Google Cloud platform is a logical container for resources like API's.DB's

Teraform

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. It allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using configuration files written in a declarative language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language).

Instead of clicking around in a cloud provider's console (like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud), you write code that describes the infrastructure you want ‚Äî and Terraform builds it for you.

üå•Ô∏è Terraform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
You can use Terraform to manage:

Compute Engine instances (VMs)

Cloud Storage buckets

Cloud SQL databases

VPC networks, subnets, firewall rules

GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)

IAM policies

IAM - Identity Access Management-who can do what on which resources

premitive -  basic access to owner,editor,viewer
pre defined - service specific roles
custom - define specific permission for custom needs

Service Account-special type of accoutn represents workload tat needs to authenticate and authorize to access GCP resources.
scope- can b assigned specific IAM roles with limited permission 
Uses- running Apps on GCP services
      Automating operations with scripts CI/CD

API's

Dailog flow API- creating playbooks,build chatbots

Big query API-DB(run sql queries)

Vertex AI-AI application work....deploy machine learning models

connectors- connecting DB in projects,GCP services to external system

cloudrun -for deploying the projects

cloud SQL API - manage RDB's like sql in the cloud


1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

2.       is the software defined network in GCP,all the subnets r interconnected and isolated from one another and allows to each environment(dev,test,prod)
3.    Each VPC can have multiple subnets, and each subnet exists within a single region and defines a range of IP addresses.

 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
A virtualized network that provides IP address management, routing, firewall rules, and VPN services for your GCP resources.

üîπ Subnet (Subnetworks)
A subnet is a regional resource ‚Äî it defines a contiguous range of internal IP addresses. You assign instances (VMs) within a subnet, and they get IPs from that range.

Firewall
set of rules tat controls incoming and outgoing trafiic to and from resources in your VPC network



üì¶ Types of Storage in GCP
Type	Service	Description	Use Cases
Object Storage	Cloud Storage	Stores data as objects in buckets	Backups, media storage, data lakes, logs
Block Storage	Persistent Disk, Local SSD	Stores data in fixed-size blocks attached to VMs	VM boot disks, databases, high-speed temporary storage
File Storage	Filestore	Shared file system over NFS	Shared file systems, CMS, lift-and-shift applications
Database Storage	Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, Firestore, Bigtable	Structured or semi-structured data storage services	Relational and NoSQL database applications

       Object storage
             Cloud storage,good for unstructured data images,backup,media

        Block Storage
              persistent disk
              local SSD disk

        File storage
                  fully managed by NFS  file server.



 Database Storage: Relational / NoSQL data with queries

Filestore: Shared file storage via NFS

Persistent Disk / Local SSD: Block storage for VMs

Cloud Storage: Object storage for blobs, files, backups, etc.


üì• 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Storage (Object Storage)
Use Cases: file uploads, backups, static website hosting, ML data storage

Inside GCP:

Use the Cloud Storage client libraries (google-cloud-storage for Python, Java, Go etc.)

Connect directly via service account credentials.

GCP services like Dataflow, Cloud Functions, and AI Platform can directly read/write to it.

Outside GCP:

Use signed URLs for secure access to individual objects.

Use Storage JSON API or XML API via HTTP requests.

For external integrations, always manage permissions with IAM roles and service account JSON keys.

You can enable VPC peering or Cloud VPN / Interconnect for private connectivity from on-premise systems.

Use signed URLs or signed policy documents for temporary external access to Cloud Storage.


VM

A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical computer does ‚Äî but it‚Äôs isolated from the underlying hardware and can run multiple virtual instances on a single physical server.



üì¶ Key Characteristics of a VM:
Runs its own Operating System (OS) (Linux, Windows, etc.)

Has virtualized CPU, memory, storage, and network resources

Managed by a hypervisor (like VMware, Hyper-V, or KVM) that divides physical hardware among multiple VMs

Can be created, configured, and deleted quickly

Isolated ‚Äî problems in one VM don‚Äôt affect others on the same host

üñ•Ô∏è How It Differs from a Physical Machine:

Physical Machine	      Virtual Machine
Hardware-based	      Software-based
One OS per server	      Multiple OSes per server
Costly scaling	      Easy, fast, scalable
Difficult to duplicate	Can be cloned/snapshotted


üìë Example Use Cases:
Hosting websites and applications

Testing software in different OS environments

Running legacy apps on modern infrastructure

Cloud infrastructure (like AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine)


üåê VM in Cloud Platforms (like GCP)
In cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform:

VMs are called Compute Engine instances

You pick machine types (CPU, memory), OS images, disk sizes

Easily create, start, stop, or delete instances via a console or API


üìÑ VM vs. Container (like Docker)
VM	                        Container
Emulates a full OS	      Shares host OS kernel
Heavyweight	                  Lightweight
Slower startup	            Fast startup
Great for monolithic apps	Great for microservices


üìå IaaS vs Other Cloud Models:
Model	You Manage	Provider Manages
IaaS	OS, apps, data	VMs, storage, networking, physical infrastructure
PaaS	Your code, configs	Everything else (runtime, scaling, OS, infra)
SaaS	Just use the app	Everything (like Gmail, Google Docs, etc.)


üì¶ IaaS relation to Virtual Machines?
IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service ‚Äî it‚Äôs a cloud computing service model where you rent virtualized compute resources (like VMs), storage, networking, and other infrastructure over the internet.

Instead of buying and managing your own physical servers, you rent them virtually on-demand.

IaaS = you manage your virtual machines (OS, apps, data)

Cloud provider manages the physical hardware, hypervisor, and virtualization infrastructure


üìå IaaS vs Other Cloud Models:
Model	      You Manage	      Provider Manages
IaaS	      OS, apps, data	      VMs, storage, networking, physical infrastructure
PaaS	      Your code, configs	Everything else (runtime, scaling, OS, infra)
SaaS	      Just use the app	      Everything (like Gmail, Google Docs, etc.)
