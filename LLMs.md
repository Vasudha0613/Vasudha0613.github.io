 What Are Large Language Models (LLMs)?
👉 LLMs are AI models trained to understand and generate human language.
They are called "large" because they are trained on massive amounts of text data and have billions (or even trillions) of parameters (think of parameters as "knowledge knobs" the model uses to understand language).

🚀 What Can LLMs Do?
Understand text
E.g.: Answer questions, summarize documents, analyze sentiment.

Generate text
E.g.: Write articles, emails, code, poems.

Chat and converse
E.g.: Power chatbots like ChatGPT, Google Bard.

Translate languages
E.g.: English → Spanish, Chinese → French.

Search and retrieve information
E.g.: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines LLMs with external databases.

🏗️ How Are They Built?
Trained on: Books, articles, websites, code, conversations.

Algorithms: Transformer architecture (popularized by Google’s Attention is All You Need paper).

Examples of LLMs:

GPT-4 (by OpenAI)

PaLM 2 / Gemini (by Google)

LLaMA (by Meta)

Claude (by Anthropic)

🛠️ LLMs in Your Insurance Project (Example):
Patient Inquiry Agent → Use LLM to generate personalized responses.

Claims Processing Agent → Summarize complex claim statuses.

RAG System → Use LLM + vector DB to retrieve answers from policy documents.
