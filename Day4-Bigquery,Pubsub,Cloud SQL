Big Query

Is a serverless,cloud-based data warehouse provided by Google cloud.
Its designed for storing,Analysing and querying massive data quickly using SQL like syntax.
It is powerful,scalable DB for bigdata Analytics.— no need to manage servers or infrastructure.

📌 Real-life Use Cases:

  Business intelligence dashboards

  Customer behavior analytics

  Real-time reporting

  Log analysis for apps or websites

  Predictive analytics using built-in ML


Google Cloud Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) 
      is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows independent services, 
      applications, and systems to communicate with each other asynchronously and reliably.


Vertex AI

Vertex AI is Google Cloud’s fully managed end-to-end machine learning (ML) platform.
It lets you build, deploy, and scale ML models without worrying about infrastructure — while also integrating easily with tools like BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Storage.

Think of it as the place where you:

Train custom ML models

Use pre-trained APIs (like Vision, Natural Language)

Deploy models to serve predictions

Automate ML workflows (pipelines)

Do MLOps (model monitoring, versioning, CI/CD for ML)


Workflow with Vertex AI:
Prepare your dataset

Train a model (using AutoML or your own custom code)

Deploy it to an endpoint

Call the endpoint for predictions



Dialogflow

  is a Google cloud  service tat lets u build conversational interfaces ,like chatbots or voice powered apps.
using natural language understanding (NLU). It’s a popular tool for integrating conversational agents into websites, mobile apps, Google Assistant, and other platforms.

There are two versions:

Dialogflow ES (Essentials) — simpler, suitable for smaller projects.

Dialogflow CX (Customer Experience) — more advanced, designed for complex, multi-turn conversations and enterprise-grade bots.


Concepts

1. Agent
The virtual NLU-powered bot that handles conversations.

2. Intents
What the user wants to do.
Example:

User says: "Book a hotel room"

Intent: book_hotel

3. Entities
Extracted values from user inputs.
Example:

"Book a hotel in Paris on Friday"

Entities: location: Paris, date: Friday

4. Contexts
Temporary memory that holds conversation state — used for multi-turn conversations.

5. Fulfillment
Custom business logic (usually via a webhook) that executes when certain intents are matched.
