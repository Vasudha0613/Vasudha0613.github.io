üß† In Simple Terms:
Google Cloud CCAI helps businesses build intelligent, AI-based customer support systems that can handle common tasks like answering questions, booking appointments, or routing calls ‚Äî just like a real human agent would.

üß∞ What Does CCAI Include?
Component	Description
Dialogflow CX/ES	Creates conversational virtual agents (chatbots/voice bots).
Agent Assist	Gives human agents real-time AI suggestions during a call.
Speech-to-Text	Converts voice calls into text so AI can understand them.

üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Example in Healthcare:
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building a healthcare assistant using CCAI:

Patient calls to ask about claim status.

A Dialogflow CX voice bot answers the call.

It uses Speech-to-Text to understand the question.

Responds using Text-to-Speech.
