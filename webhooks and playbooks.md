🔔 What Are Webhooks?
Webhooks are automated messages sent from one system to another when a specific event happens. Think of them as a “push notification” for your backend systems.

🧠 In Simple Terms:
A webhook is like saying:
“Hey, when this thing happens, send data to this URL.”

✅ Example:
Let’s say you’re using Dialogflow CX (a chatbot platform). When a user asks for their claim status:

Dialogflow calls your webhook.

The webhook fetches real-time claim data from your system.

Dialogflow replies with the actual claim status.

🔄 How Webhooks Work:
Trigger: Something happens (e.g., a user makes a request).

Webhook fires: Dialogflow or another app sends an HTTP request (usually POST) to your webhook URL.

Webhook receiver: Your server or cloud function handles the request, processes it, and sends a response.

🔧 Common Uses:
Use Case	What Happens
Dialogflow Webhook	Sends user query to a backend API
Payment gateway (like Stripe)	Sends webhook when payment is successful
GitHub Webhook	Triggers CI/CD pipeline on code push
Form submission	Sends form data to a backend server

📦 In Google Cloud:
You can host a webhook using:

Cloud Functions

Cloud Run

App Engine

You just expose an HTTP endpoint, and other systems (like Dialogflow CX, Vertex AI Agent Builder, Stripe, etc.) will send requests to it.


📘 What Are Playbooks?
In general, playbooks are step-by-step guides or automated workflows used to complete specific tasks — often used in IT operations, cloud management, DevOps, or security.

🧠 Simple Definition:
A playbook is like a recipe: it tells systems what to do, in what order, and how — usually to solve a common problem or automate a repetitive task.

🛠️ Types of Playbooks:
Area	What Playbooks Do
DevOps (e.g., Ansible)	Automate server setup, deployments, configuration changes
Security	Respond to threats (e.g., isolate a machine, block IPs)
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)	Guide users to solve issues or run cloud automation workflows
Incident Response	Define how to handle outages or system failures
Conversational AI (e.g., Vertex AI, Dialogflow)	Guide bot behavior step-by-step for user interactions

🤖 Playbooks in Google Cloud (GCP):
In GCP, "playbooks" often refer to:

Operational Playbooks (in Cloud Operations Suite / Security Command Center)

Guides or automations for handling incidents, alerts, or threats.

AI/ML Playbooks (in Vertex AI or Dialogflow)

Predefined workflows for common AI use cases like:

Building a chatbot

Creating a data pipeline

Setting up model training

Terraform or Deployment Manager Scripts

Infrastructure as code playbooks that provision cloud resources.

✅ Example Use Case:
Playbook for onboarding a new microservice in GCP might:

Create a Cloud Run service.

Configure IAM roles.

Set up logging and monitoring.

Deploy the container image.
